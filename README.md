  <h1>Painter App</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The Painter app is an Android application that allows users to paint pictures. Built upon the professor's starter app by Robert Bailey, which included a screen and a painter, I implemented additional functionality to enhance the painting experience. Users can change the color and size of the brush, change the background, and undo the last drawing action.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>

    <li><strong>Painting Functionality:</strong> Enables users to paint pictures using various brush sizes and styles.</li>

  </ul>
